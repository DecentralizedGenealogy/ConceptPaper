Think of you are doing some genealogic research for your family, put things together in a software tool
and at some day there is a mail in your inbox from another person doing research itself having an overlapping
ancestor tree with you. From now on you share all data concerning the people in the overlapping tree
having a full copy of all data in your own database.

You are using FediGree.

These pages are a starting point to find and discuss a concept to bring this to live.
They are organised following the [arc42 template](https://arc42.org/).
