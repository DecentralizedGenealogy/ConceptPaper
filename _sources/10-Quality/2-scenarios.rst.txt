   **Contents**

Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements
using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at
the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

-  Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case
   scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain
   stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s
   efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s
   request within one second.

-  Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its
   immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is
   implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

   **Motivation**

Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to more easily
measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2) more
precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and
evaluated.
