.. container:: formalpara-title

   **Contents**

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your
system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific
input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which
channel.

.. container:: formalpara-title

   **Motivation**

Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical
interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure
or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.. container:: formalpara-title

   **Form**

E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels
and input/output.
