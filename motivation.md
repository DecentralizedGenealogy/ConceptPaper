# Motivation

Think about following user stories:

---

As a genealogist I want to store all my research data in a trusted environment
(like my own workstation computer or a server only I myself can access) so I
can be sure that no unauthorized person or profit oriented organization can
access and use my data without my full consent.

---

As a genealogist I want to share data with other genealogists doing research
about the same people so we can collaborate in our research and the same
research has not to be repeated by several people.

---

Starting with these I came to following concept:

There is a need for
- some cool software to manage the data (as there is much already present, paid and free)
- an algorithm to find and bind duplicate trees at between software instances
